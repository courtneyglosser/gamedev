Fill - A Drench Clone
=====================

Written in Python3 using the PyGame library.

Python3 version 3.4.3.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Using 64-bit Python3, I'm installing 64 PyGame package:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

sudo apt-get install python-pygame works for python2 and pygame.

Support seems to be spotty for pygame support using pip3 for installtion.

Going to proceed with Python2

There is a script in this repository to test out the various PyGame modules:

python-book/verify-pygame-modules.py
